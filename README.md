# Radar System Simulation
The aim of this project was to design a PC-based Monostatic Pulse Radar which employs the same Phase Array at both the radarâ€™s Transmitter and Receiver for detecting and localising multiple complex targets.

#### Summary

With the use of MATLAB I created a function that generates the backscatter data for a specified range of steering directions. The program scans the backscatter data and detects the presence of any possible target. After confirming the detection of one or more targets, the MATLAB code also estimates the parameters of this target (e.g. range, steering direction, RCS, type of complexity).
